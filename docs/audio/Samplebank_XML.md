# Samplebank XML Format Specification

Samplebank XMLs describe which sample files to include in a particular samplebank.

```xml
<SampleBank
    Name="<C Indentifier>"
    Index="<uint>"
    Medium="<Medium>"
    CachePolicy="<CachePolicy>"
    BufferBug="<bool>"
>
<!-- Begins a new samplebank. -->
<!--    Name: The name of the samplebank. -->
<!--    Index: The index of the samplebank in the samplebank table. Must be a unique index. -->
<!--    Medium: The storage medium, from the SampleMedium enum. -->
<!--    CachePolicy: The cache policy, from the AudioCacheLoadType enum. -->
<!--    BufferBug: Whether this samplebank suffers from a buffer clearing bug present in the original audio tools. For matching only. -->

    <Pointer

    />
    <!-- Create an alternate index that refers to this samplebank. -->
    <!--    Index: The alternative index, must be unique like the 'true' index. -->

    <Sample
        Name="<C Identifier>"

    <!--    Name: Name of this sample. -->
    <!--    Path: Path to aifc file (typically in $(BUILD_DIR)/assets/samples/) -->

    <Blob
